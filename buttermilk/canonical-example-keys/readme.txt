Canonical Key Examples	

Each folder contains the same key materials split up into the three modes: Open, Sealed, 
and For Publication. The password on all of the sealed keys is "password". 

Understand that in the normal case, only the For Publication mode would be used to post
the key to the public. The sealed mode would be used for normal storage of the key, and
the open mode would be used only in the context of holding the key materials in memory,
for an example, etc.
