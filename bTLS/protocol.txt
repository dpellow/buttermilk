bTLS uses frames, which are analogs to TLS records. A frame has 

a) a 1 byte control code (analog to a TLS content type)

	21 - Alert
	22 - Handshake
	23 - Application
	24 - Heartbeat
	25 - Normal Close
	
There is no protocol version sent in the frames.

b) a 4 byte length field.
	 
   The length does not include the initial control byte or these 4 bytes. This field might be 
   better called the "remaining length"
   

c) a message from the above 4 categories

Alert

	1) a one byte code
		3 - Info
		5 - Error
	2) Informational message - String in UTF-8 encoding
	

Handshake - basically an ECDH that encrypts an ephemeral key. 

	1) Client Public Key
	2) Server Public Key, Server encrypted 256 bytes (to use as asymmetric key), iv or nonce as required
    

Application

	1) encrypted data
