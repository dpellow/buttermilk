Buttermilk contains the first open source java implementation of G J Croll's !BiEntropy Algorithm. Binary Entropy is an entropy measure of actual bits, rather than the characters. This is very useful for password analysis or work in the context of key stretching and password-based encryption (PBE).

From the command line:

{{{
java -cp buttermilk.jar com.cryptoregistry.utility.app.BiEntropy -a password1

{
  "version" : "Buttermilk BiEntropy v1.0",
  "algorithm" : "TresBiEntropy",
  "input" : "password1",
  "biEntropy" : "0.92",
  "bitsOfEntropy" : 66
}
}}}

!TresBiEntropy uses a logarithmic algorithm rather than a power series.

For individual character bientropy, the !BiEntropy algorithm computes a power series:

{{{

java -cp buttermilk.jar com.cryptoregistry.utility.app.BiEntropy -a x
{
  "version" : "Buttermilk BiEntropy v1.0",
  "algorithm" : "BiEntropy",
  "input" : "x",
  "bits" : "[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]",
  "biEntropy" : "0.11",
  "bitsOfEntropy" : 1
}
}}}
