Buttermilk contains the first open source java implementation of G J Croll's !BiEntropy Algorithm. Binary Entropy is an entropy measure of actual bits, rather than the characters. This is very useful for password analysis or work in the context of key stretching and password-based encryption (PBE).

From the command line:

For individual character bientropy (one byte), the !BiEntropy algorithm computes a power series:

{{{

java -cp buttermilk.jar com.cryptoregistry.utility.app.BiEntropy -a x
{
  "version" : "Buttermilk BiEntropy v1.0",
  "algorithm" : "BiEntropy",
  "input" : "x",
  "bits" : "[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]",
  "biEntropy" : "0.11",
  "bitsOfEntropy" : 1
}
}}} 

This is useful for academic work. For practical analysis of arbitrary length strings we use the !TresBiEntropy variant:

{{{
java -cp buttermilk.jar com.cryptoregistry.utility.app.BiEntropy -a password1

{
  "version" : "Buttermilk BiEntropy v1.0",
  "algorithm" : "TresBiEntropy",
  "input" : "password1",
  "biEntropy" : "0.92",
  "bitsOfEntropy" : 66
}
}}}

!TresBiEntropy is a logarithmic summation rather than a power series.
