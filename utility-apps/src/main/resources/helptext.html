	<h1>cryptoregistry.com Registration Key Materials&reg; Wizard</h1>
	
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	
	<p>Welcome to the registration wizard. <b>cryptoregistry.com</b> uses a simple JSON-formatted file format
	which you will upload once it is complete. This wizard helps build up that data file. The file is
	 required to request an initial registration. Later
	stages of the registration (such as payment for crypto services or requesting Identity Points&reg;) are 
	handled online. The initial registration process including using this software, upload, and submission 
	is <b>free</b>.</p>
	
	<p>The registration wizard consists of several tabs. These are intended to be used more or less in 
	order moving from left to right:</p> 
	
	<ol>
		<li>Introduction (this tab)</li>
		<li>Select Registration Handle</li>
	    <li>Initial Key</li>
	    <li>Personal Contact</li>
	    <li>Business Contact</li>
	    <li>Signature</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Each tab builds the registration file starting with the registration handle itself and then moving through
	your initial encryption key, contact info appropriate to your situation, and finally a digital signature using your
	own key.</p>
	
	
	
	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	
	<h3>What Is <b>cryptoregistry.com</b>?</h3>
	
	<p><b>cryptoregistry.com</b> is part of a new Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) designed by David R. Smith. 
	The PKI design consists
	of an open source cryptographic library implemented in the Java programming language, called Buttermilk; a new
	security protocol (loosely modeled on TLS) called bTLS (aka "beatles"); new cryptographic formats,
	utilities, and programs, and a web site to support it all.</p>
	
	<h3>What is a Handle?</h3>
	
	<p>Handles are UTF-8 encoded text strings which follow certain rules. The intention of a handle is to
	work as a moniker or nick-name for your PKI use. The handle provides <i>a unique
	textual value</i> to use as a way to locate your key materials in the registry. Here are some examples 
	of valid handles:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Chinese Knees</li>
		<li>ba80f000-d054-11e4-8477-0002a5d5c51b</li>
		<li>mywebsite.com.au</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>These examples may not seem to have much in common but they all conform to the following rules:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Consists of more than one "word"</li>
		<li>The "words" may consist of any combination of UTF-8 characters, max length of a word is 128 bytes</li>
		<li>The "words" are separated by either a space, a dash, or a dot (period).</li>
		<li>If the separator is a <i>dot (period)</i> character, then parsing rules for domain names are in play.</li>
		<li>If the separator is a <i>dash</i>, then parsing rules for UUIDs are in play.</li>
	</ol> 
	
	<p>The first example, "Chinese Knees", is a typical or human-readable handle. It uses spaces 
	(in this case one space) to separate words.</p>
	
	<p>The second example is a machine-generated UUID, which is also acceptable as a handle. It has "words"
	separated by dashes, but no spaces or periods.</p>
	
	<p>The third example is a domain name. Every domain name is a potential handle, but not every handle would
	qualify as a domain name.</p>
	
	<h3>What is a Registration Handle&reg;?</h3>
	
	<p>A registration handle is a handle chosen by a registrant (i.e., you) for use with a cryptoregistry.com registration.</p>
	
	<p>The registration handle will be publicly visible and internet-searchable, and depending on the level of
	PKI validation your use-case requires, it my be directly tied back to personal or business details about you,
	so it is worth thinking about and choosing wisely. You are only allowed to have one personal handle, and
	one per business or web site entity which you legally control.</p>
	
	<p>Some guidelines, more are found in the Terms of Service:</p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>Do not include your legal name or personally identifiable details like phone numbers in your peronsal handle. There are millions of people named John Smith. Try to think of something
		more original which fits your personality.</li>
		<li>You can use your legal business name as a business registration Handle, but keep in mind you must own the
		trademark for that phrase or name.</li>
		<li>You must claim copyright as part of your handle creation upon registration. I.e., you must assert the handle
		is your unique intellectual property and creatively yours.</li>
		<li>If you cannot think of anything creative, a unique UUID can be generated instead - but this is harder to remember
		or tell your friends.</li>
		<li>Pornographic or sexually offensive phrases are not allowed, although a certain amount of 
		creative license is reasonable. Do you
		really want people to look up your on-line handle by searching for "Big Dick 10?" Unless you
		are a working porn star you should choose something less provocative.</li> 
		<li>Hate speech is not allowed in a registration handle. Do you really want to be known online as "Jew Hater 27"? 
		Unless you are a member of an ultra-right wing political party
		you should choose something less provocative for your personal handle.</li>
	</ul>
