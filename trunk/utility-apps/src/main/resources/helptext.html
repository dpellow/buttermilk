	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	
	<p>Welcome to the registration wizard. <b>cryptoregistry.com</b> uses a simple JSON-formatted file format for
	transactions. This wizard helps build up the data file required to request an initial registration. Later
	stages of the registration (such as payment for crypto services or requesting Identity Points&reg;) are 
	handled online. The initial registration process including using this software, upload, and submission 
	is <b>free</b>.</p>
	
	<p>The registration wizard consists of several tabs. These are intended to be used more or less in 
	order moving from left to right:</p> 
	
	<ol>
		<li>Introduction (this tab)</li>
		<li>Select Registration Handle</li>
	    <li>Initial Key</li>
	    <li>Personal Contact</li>
	    <li>Business Contact</li>
	    <li>Signature</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Each tab builds the registration file starting with the registration handle itself and then moving through
	your initial encryption key, contact info appropriate to your situation, and finally a digital signature using your
	own key.</p>

	utilities, and programs, and a web site to support it all.</p>
